## What is GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European privacy law approved by the European Commission in 2016 (www.eugdpr.org). The GDPR will replace a prior European Union privacy directive known which has been the basis of European data protection law since 1995. The GDPR is an attempt to strengthen, harmonize, and modernize EU data protection law and enhance individual rights and freedoms, consistent with the European understanding of privacy as a fundamental human right. The GDPR regulates, among other things, how individuals and organizations may obtain, use, store, and eliminate personal data. It will have a significant impact on businesses around the world.

GDPR will become enforceable on May 25, 2018, and will set a high bar for global privacy rights and compliance. We are actively preparing our business and compliance processes for the GDPR to take effect.

## What can you expect from us?

AzureSaturday cares about your personal information and we will be prepared to address any requests made by our stakeholders (speakers, attendees & partners), related to their individual rights under the GDPR:

 Right to be forgotten: you can contact us to delete your personal information and to remove all records we have on file.
 Right to object: you can contact us for any event where you feel your data has been used inappropriately and we will take the necessary actions to investigate these type of events.
 Right to rectification: you can contact us to inform us of any data update necessary for your account.
 Right of access: you can contact us at any time to request the personal information we store.

## What personal information do we store?

Over the years we have collected basic information of people joining the yearly AzureSaturday conference. All people signing up for AzureSaturday (buying a ticket or being invited), will need to register via Eventbrite – our selected on-line ticketing platform – where the following personal information is requested: First Name, Last Name, Email, Job Title, Phone Number, Home Address and Company.

By signing up for AzureSaturday, every person agrees to the ticket terms and conditions. During the conference every attendee is free to decide which partner may use his/her personal data (Name, Phone, Company and Email) by accepting the offer to scan their personal badge. AzureSaturday only shares personal information from attendees with partners who got an explicit permission to scan the badge of individual conference attendees.

For email campaigns to our target audience, we use Mailchimp where individual subscribers are presented with options to manage their profile and subscription.
